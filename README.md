# Customer Behavior Analysis with Transactional Data

## Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on understanding and analyzing customer behavior based on transactional data. The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive valuable insights into customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and overall behavior.

## Project Structure

- **data:** Contains the dataset used for analysis (e.g., transactional data).
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and modeling.
- **scripts:** Any scripts used for data processing or analysis.
- **images:** Visualizations and plots generated during analysis.
- **README.md:** Overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-behavior-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory:

   ```bash
   cd notebooks
   ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in sequential order:

   - `01_data_cleaning.ipynb`
   - `02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`
   - `03_modeling.ipynb` (if applicable)

3. Follow the instructions within each notebook to execute the code and analyze the data.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into customer segments, purchasing patterns, correlations between products, seasonal trends, and anomalies in transactional data. These insights can be used to inform marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction.
